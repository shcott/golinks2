  <h1>How to use Golinks</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Golinks! To return to this page at any time, type <code>/?</code> into the Golinks launcher.</p>
  <p>Golinks is a bookmarks manager that works like a personal URL shortener. It's perfect for bookmarking webpages that you use often, all without using a mouse.</p>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>If you have used Quicksilver, Alfred, Launchy, Wox, or Gnome Do, you'll feel right at home with Golinks' launcher interface. Otherwise, you might find this guide useful to show you how to get started.</p>
  <h3>Step 1: Open the launcher</h3>
  <p>The default shortcut to open the Golinks launcher is <code>Ctrl+Shift+Space</code> (on Macs, <code>Cmd+Shift+Space</code>. You can also click on the Golinks icon to the right of the address bar.</p>
  <h3>Step 2: Create your first golink</h3>
  <p>Type <code>/mark my first golink</code>, then press <code>Enter</code>. The <code>/mark</code> command bookmarks the current page. The Golinks launcher will close after you complete the action.</p>
  <h3>Step 3: Visit your first golink</h3>
  <p>Open a new tab and then open the Golinks launcher again. The launcher shows the most recently added and visited golinks when opened, so your new golink will appear there. Press <code>Enter</code> to visit it.</p>
  <p>Once you collect many golinks, you can start typing the keyword for the link you want into the search bar to find it. When you press <code>Enter</code>, it will follow the highlighted link.</p>
  <h3>Step 4: Everything else</h3>
  <p>Open the Golinks launcher and type <code>/</code>. This will show you everything else you can do with Golinks.</p>
  <p>Congrats! You now know how to mark and follow golinks! If you find Golinks useful, please be sure to leave a review on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/golinks-2/ifddlpbonpoebonmmmpellcgigmjbknj">the Chrome web store page</a>.</p>
  <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
  <h3>Import links</h3>
  <p>To import your existing bookmarks in bulk, use the <code>/list</code> command to get to Chrome's bookmark manager and then drag and drop your bookmarks into the Golinks folder. Do not drag entire folders into the Golinks folder; Golinks will ignore them.</p>
  <h3>Open links in new tabs and windows</h3>
  <p>To open a golink in a new tab, hold down <code>Ctrl</code> (<code>Cmd</code> on Macs) when clicking the link or pressing <code>Enter</code>.</p>
  <p>To open a golink in the background, hold down <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>Shift</code>.</p>
  <p>To open a golink in a new window, hold down <code>Shift</code>.</p>
  <h3>Search your Chrome bookmarks</h3>
  <p>You can use the Golinks launcher to find any bookmark in Chrome. In the Golinks launcher, type <code>/search</code> and then any part of the name or URL of the bookmark you're looking for.</p>
  <h3>Navigate to open tabs</h3>
  <p>The Golinks launcher allows you to search your open tabs by title or URL using the <code>/tab</code> command.</p>
  <h3>Search browsing history</h3>
  <p>Use the <code>/history</code> command to find a page from your recent browsing history.</p>
  <h3>Change the launcher shortcut</h3>
  <p>You can change which keyboard shortcut opens the Golinks launcher in <a id="cmdconfig" href="chrome://extensions/configureCommands" target="_blank">Chrome's extension configuration</a>.</p>
  <script src="/js/janklink.js"></script>
  <h3>Use variable golinks</h3>
  <p>You can add to the end of a URL when you visit it by typing a <code>/</code> after your golink keyword. For example, if you bookmarked <code>https://reddit.com/r/</code> as a golink using the keyword <code>r</code>, you can visit your favorite subreddits by typing <code>r/funny</code> or <code>r/all</code> into the Golinks launcher.</p>
  <p>Another great site to do this with is GitHub. If you have GitHub bookmarked as <code>gh</code>, you could view the source code for this extension using <code>gh/xsznix/golinks2</code>.</p>
  <h2>Technical Details and Caveats</h2>
  <h3>How Golinks stores its data</h3>
  <p>Golinks creates a special folder in your Chrome bookmarks to store golinks. It identifies this folder by its title, "Golinks". You may move this folder if you prefer to put it somewhere else, but if you rename it, Golinks will not find the golinks inside it. If you already had a folder called "Golinks" before you installed Golinks, Golinks will use that folder for golinks. If you uninstall Golinks, your golinks will not be deleted so that you can still access them. If you then reinstall Golinks, it will use the Golinks folder from your previous installation (unless you renamed or deleted it).</p>
  <h3>Use your Golinks everywhere</h3>
  <p>Your Golinks are available anywhere you are signed into Chrome and are syncing your bookmarks. To access your golinks on mobile Chrome, use Chrome's bookmark search and navigate to your Golinks folder. The golinks you most recently accessed on desktop will be at the top, and accessing golinks on mobile will not move them to the top of the folder like on desktop.</p>
